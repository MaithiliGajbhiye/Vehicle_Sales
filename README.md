## Project Overview:
The classicmodels database is a sample database designed to illustrate how a relational database works in a small business context. It provides a practical example for learning and testing SQL queries, database design principles, and relational database management systems (RDBMS) concepts.

This sample database includes tables representing various business entities such as customers, employees, products, orders, and payments. The data and relationships between these tables are structured to showcase common scenarios in business operations, making it an excellent resource for both beginners and experienced users looking to improve their SQL skills or test database applications.
